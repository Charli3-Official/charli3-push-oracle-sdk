## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software very seriously. If you find a vulnerability, please follow these steps to report it:

1.  **Do not open a public issue.** Publicly reporting a vulnerability can put the community at risk.
2.  Send an email to **info@charli3.io** with a description of the vulnerability.
3.  Include as much information as possible to help us reproduce the issue.
4.  We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours.
5.  We will keep you updated on our progress as we investigate and fix the issue.
6.  Once the issue is fixed, we will publish a security advisory and give you credit for the discovery (if you wish).

Thank you for helping keep the Charli3 ecosystem safe!
